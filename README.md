## News

- **2025-09-22**: Release of first version of project data and code.

## Todo

- [x] Update the first version of data and code for this project.
- [ ] Update a second version of data and code with more details.

## Abstract

Urban comfort shapes how people inhabit cities and can be assessed through modelling of environmental and social conditions. Beyond these observable states lies urban comfort potential‚Äîthe latent scope for improving comfort across activities and places‚Äîwhich remains largely invisible without systematic analysis. 

We examine Singapore as a global city, analysing **44,228 geotagged image‚Äìtext posts** to classify five activity types and link them to spatial features using surveys and causal inference. A hybrid urban comfort index achieves strong validation (**R¬≤ > 0.8** across all activity categories) and, combined with **Ising Monte Carlo optimisation**, enables targeted simulations of improvement strategies.

**Keywords:** human-centred GeoAI, urban optimisation, urban planning, social media, geospatial modelling

## Key Features

### üèôÔ∏è Urban Comfort Index (UCI) Analysis
- **Multi-activity Assessment**: Evaluation across 5 social activities:
  - Eating & Drinking
  - Nature Exploration  
  - Community Gathering
  - Walking & Exercising
  - Urban Sightseeing

### üìä Comprehensive Data Integration
- **Streetscape Perception (SP)**: Environmental comfort factors including greenery, shading, imageability, and human scale
- **Functional Convenience (FC)**: Point-of-interest ratings, density analysis, and user reviews
- **Accessibility (AC)**: Transportation connectivity and transit access metrics
- **Context Density (CD)**: Population, building, and leisure space density analysis

### üéØ Policy-weighted Urban Comfort Index (pUCI)
- **5 Strategic Planning Scenarios**:
  - pUCI_1: Balanced Development
  - pUCI_2: Eco-Livable City Initiative  
  - pUCI_3: Community Cohesion Drive
  - pUCI_4: Active Walkability Focus
  - pUCI_5: Tourism Strategy Development

### üîß Advanced Optimization Framework
- **Ising Monte Carlo Optimization**: Systematic spatial optimization with simulated annealing
- **Causal Inference**: Identifying activity-specific spatial drivers using causal forest models
- **Socio-spatial Variation Analysis**: Understanding policy-sensitive vs location-sensitive features
- **Geospatial Modelling**: HGWR-based UCI construction with hybrid weighting approach

## Data Structure

```
Data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data_UCI_pUCI.gpkg          # Main UCI and pUCI dataset (58+ spatial features)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Optimisation_Result/        # 675 optimization result files
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ising_optimisation_UCP_*.gpkg (630 files)    # Spatial optimization results
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UCP_ising_energy_evolution_*.csv (45 files) # Energy evolution tracking
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  - `geopandas` - Geospatial data processing
  - `matplotlib` - Data visualization
  - `pandas` - Data analysis
  - `numpy` - Numerical computing
  - `tqdm` - Progress bars for data loading

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sijie-Yang/Urban-Comfort-Potential.git
cd Urban-Comfort-Potential
pip install geopandas matplotlib pandas numpy tqdm
```

## Usage

### Quick Start
Run the main analysis notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook RunMe.ipynb
```

**Note**: Each main section (marked with ## headers) in the notebook can be run independently. You can execute any section without needing to run the previous sections first.

### Analysis Workflow

The notebook is organized into two main analytical components:

#### üèôÔ∏è **UCI Assessment Result Analytics**
1. **Import UCI Data**: Load comprehensive urban comfort index dataset with 58+ spatial features
2. **Visualize UCI Patterns**: Generate 5-level classification maps for each social activity:
   - Eating & Drinking
   - Nature Exploration  
   - Community Gathering
   - Walking & Exercising
   - Urban Sightseeing

#### üéØ **UCP Optimisation Result Analytics**
1. **Create UCP Geodataframe**: Initialize spatial framework for optimization analysis
2. **Load Feature-Policy Pairs**: Import 45 optimization result files (5 policies √ó 9 features)
3. **Policy-specific UCP Analysis**: Examine UCP patterns for each policy scenario:
   - UCP_1: Balanced Development
   - UCP_2: Eco-Livable City Initiative
   - UCP_3: Community Cohesion Drive
   - UCP_4: Active Walkability Focus
   - UCP_5: Tourism Strategy Development
4. **Delta-UCP Analysis**: Calculate specialized UCP differences between policies
5. **Administrative District Analysis**: Aggregate UCP outcomes at district level
6. **PCA Analysis**: Perform principal component analysis of Delta-UCP patterns
7. **District Classification**: Categorize districts based on UCP characteristics
